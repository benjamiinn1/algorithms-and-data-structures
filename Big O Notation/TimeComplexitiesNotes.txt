TIME COMPLEXITY = analyze runtime of an algorithm as the size of inputs increases

An algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n), as n increases

USUALLY THESE ARE TRUE:
1. variable assignment and arithmetic operations are constant
2. accessing elements in an array are constant.
3. looping increases the complexity for length of n.
