list

pro: order
cons: slow

should really only be used when order is necessary.

Search: O(n)
Access: O(1) - shortcut to each element. arr[10000000] (jumps directly to 10000000 position)
Insert: arr.push O(1) simple, constant time. (when adding anywhere besides end, index must change for everything. O(n))
Remove: arr.pop O(1) simple, constant time. (when removing anywhere besides end, index must change for everything. O(n))

Array Methods
anything that does not require to re-index O(1) Ex(push, pop)
anything that requires reindexing O(n) Ex(shift, unshift, slice, forEach, map, filter)
