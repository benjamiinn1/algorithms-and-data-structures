SPACE COMPLEXITY = memory required to run code in algorithm

auxiliary space complexity = space required by algorithm only. DOES NOT INCLUDE INPUT SPACE.
(we really only care about auxiliary space complexity)

primitives are usually constant. Ex(bool, number, null) O(1)
Strings/Arrays/Objects space required grows based on length/number of keys O(n)
