ALGORITHM = set of steps to accomplish a certain task
(almost everything revolves around algorithms)

step 1: understand problem
  - restate the problem in your own words
  - what are the inputs
  - what should the outputs be
  - questions about edge cases
  - questions about null data
  - do I have enough information to solve the problem
  - how should I label the data

step 2: concrete examples
  - make simple examples and then create more complex examples of the function

step 3: break it down
  - write sudo code comments for what you are trying to create.

step 4: solve or simplify
  -  Fill in the blanks of what you know and can easily create.
  - If not sure how to do a part, do not stick on it. finish the rest.
  - talk through the things you understand. If stuck, simplify the problem and make it work, then go back to larger problem.

step 5: look bakc and refactor
  - determine if your code solves the problem in an effective way.
  - look at alternative solutions and determine if they are a better way.
